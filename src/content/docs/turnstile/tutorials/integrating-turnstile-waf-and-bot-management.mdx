Cloudflare's security tools offer powerful protection for web applications. In this tutorial, we'll explore how to integrate Cloudflare Turnstile, Web Application Firewall (WAF), and Bot Management into an existing authentication system. This combination creates a robust defense against various threats, including automated attacks and malicious login attempts.

## Overview

To use WAF and Bot Management, your site must have its DNS pointing through Cloudflare. However, Turnstile can be used independently on any site, even those not on Cloudflare's network. We'll cover how to implement all three, but you can focus on Turnstile if your site isn't on Cloudflare.

These tools work well together, by working on different layers of the application:

- WAF filters malicious traffic based on network signals.
- Bot Management analyzes requests to identify and mitigate automated threats.
- Turnstile examines client-side and browser signals to distinguish between human users and bots.

By combining server-side (WAF and Bot Management) and client-side (Turnstile) security measures, you can combine together multiple layers of defense to create a protection system that is difficult for attackers to circumvent.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have:

- A Cloudflare account with access to WAF and Bot Management (if using)
- An existing JavaScript/TypeScript-based route handling authentication

In this example, we'll use a simple login form written in plain HTML to demonstrate how to integrate Turnstile into your application. In the backend, we will use a stubbed out authentication route, written in TypeScript, to handle the login request. You may replace this with the language of your choice. As long as your language or framework is able to make an external HTTP request to Turnstile's API, you can integrate Turnstile into your application.

## Configuring WAF and Bot Management

If your site is on Cloudflare's network and under an Enterprise plan, set up WAF and Bot Management:

### Issue challenges for potential bot traffic

1. Log in to your Cloudflare dashboard.
2. Navigate to Security > WAF.
3. Create a new custom WAF rule, clicking "Edit expression":
   - Field: "Bot Score"
	 - Operator: "less than or equal to"
	 - Value: "30"
   - Action: "Managed Challenge"

This configuration challenges requests with a low bot score, leveraging network signals to identify potential threats before they reach your application. You may customize the score threshold based on your specific use case.

## Setting up Cloudflare Turnstile

Turnstile can be used on any site, regardless of whether it's on Cloudflare's network:

1. In your Cloudflare dashboard, go to Security > Turnstile.
2. Create a new Turnstile site.
3. Add your domain to the Turnstile configuration.

Turnstile adds an extra layer of security by analyzing browser and client-side signals, complementing the server-side checks performed by WAF and Bot Management.

### Enable the option to use the existing clearance cookie

If your site is on Cloudflare, enable the option to use the existing clearance cookie in Turnstile settings. This integration allows Turnstile to use the Clearance Cookie as part of its determination of whether a user should receive a challenge. This integration is optional, but if you already are making use of WAF and Bot Management, it's recommended to enable this option.

## Integrating Turnstile into Your Application

There are two components to integrating Turnstile into your application: the Turnstile widget and the server-side validation logic.

### Add the Turnstile widget to your login form

Add the Turnstile widget to your existing login form:

```html
<form id="login-form">
  <input type="text" id="username" placeholder="Username" required>
  <input type="password" id="password" placeholder="Password" required>
  <div class="cf-turnstile" data-sitekey="YOUR_SITE_KEY"></div>
  <button type="submit">Log in</button>
</form>

<script src="https://challenges.cloudflare.com/turnstile/v0/api.js" async defer></script>
```

Replace `YOUR_SITE_KEY` with your actual Turnstile site key.

## Handling the Login Request

In your existing authentication route, add Turnstile validation:

```typescript
async function validateTurnstileToken(ip: string, token: string, secret: string): Promise<boolean> {
  const response = await fetch('https://challenges.cloudflare.com/turnstile/v0/siteverify', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({ ip, secret, response: token })
  });

  const outcome = await response.json();
  return outcome.success;
}

// Assume that this is a TypeScript route handler.
// You may replace this with a different implementation,
// based on your language or framework
export async function onRequestPost(context) {
  const { request, env } = context;
  const { username, password, token } = await request.json();

  // Validate Turnstile token
  const secretKey = env.TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY;
  const ip = request.headers.get('CF-Connecting-IP');
  const turnstileValid = await validateTurnstileToken(ip, token, secretKey);
  if (!turnstileValid) {
    // Return back to the login page with an error message
    return Response.redirect('/login', 302, {
      headers: {
        'Location': '/login?error=invalid-turnstile-token'
      }
    });
  }

  // Perform your existing authentication logic here
  const isValidLogin = await checkCredentials(username, password);

  if (isValidLogin) {
    return new Response(JSON.stringify({ message: 'Login successful' }), {
      status: 200,
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }
    });
  } else {
    return new Response(JSON.stringify({ error: 'Invalid credentials' }), {
      status: 401,
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }
    });
  }
}

async function checkCredentials(username: string, password: string): Promise<boolean> {
  // Your existing credential checking logic
}
```

This setup ensures that the Turnstile token is validated server-side before proceeding with the login process, adding an extra layer of security based on client-side signals.

## Testing

After deployment, you will want to test your integration. Because your bot score will be low, you will probably not receive a challenge. However, you can add additional rules as needed to force a redirect to the challenge page. Some options to do this are:

1) Add a WAF rule that always forwards your IP address to the challenge page.
2) Add a WAF rule that checks for the presence of a query parameter, such as `?challenge=true`.

## Best Practices

1. Always validate the Turnstile token server-side before checking credentials.
2. Use environment variables to store sensitive information like your Turnstile secret key.
3. Implement proper error handling and logging to monitor for potential security issues.

By combining Turnstile with WAF and Bot Management, you can create a system that secures your application at the network layer, while also providing an extra layer of protection using client-side signals. This approach makes it significantly more difficult for malicious actors to automate attacks against your login system.
